<h3>Additon of matrices :</h3>
<p>Matrix addition explains the addition of two or more matrices. Unlike arithmetic addition of numbers, matrix addition will follow different rules. The order of matrices should be the same, before adding them. Before going into the addition of the matrix, let us have a brief idea of what are matrices. In mathematics, a matrix is a rectangular array of numbers, expressions or symbols, arranged in rows and columns. Horizontal Rows are denoted by “m” whereas the Vertical Columns are denoted by “n.” Thus a matrix (m x n) has m and n numbers of rows and columns respectively. We also know about different types of matrices such as square matrix, row matrix, null matrix, diagonal matrix, scalar matrix, identity matrix, diagonal matrix, triangular matrix, etc. Now, let us now focus on how to perform the basic operation on matrices such as matrix addition and subtraction with examples.</p>

<h1>VECTORS!!!</h1>

<h3>Vectors :</h3>
<p>Vector in physics, a quantity that has both magnitude and directions. It is typically represented by an arrow whose direction is the same as that of the quantity and whose. Although a vector has magnitude and direction. It does not have position. That is, as long as its length is not change, a vector is not altered parallel to its.</p>
